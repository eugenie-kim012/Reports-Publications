| **UNICEF Tanzania: Towards a Cholera-Free Nation Project (End-of-Project Evaluation Report, USD 4.5 million) (2025)** | KOICA ODA Library | [View Report](https://tmslib.koica.go.kr/search/detail/CATKCA000000046001) | The UNICEF Tanzania Cholera Eradication Project (2019â€“2023, USD 4.5 million) targeted 1.8 million residents across Zanzibar to reduce under-five and maternal mortality through integrated WASH and health interventions. The evaluation confirmed high relevance, effectiveness, and efficiencyâ€”aligned with **Zanzibar Vision 2050**, **KOICA priorities**, and the **SDGs (3, 6, 11, 13)**. It achieved 100 % of objectives, maintaining zero cholera cases and improving hygiene behaviours and water quality despite budget constraints and COVID-19 disruptions. Institutionalisation under the Vice-Presidentâ€™s Office and community engagement ensured sustainability, though fiscal and infrastructural challenges remained. Recommended as a model for future waterborne-disease programmes integrating data-driven surveillance, cultural adaptation, and national ownership. |
| **Investigation into the Alternative Payment System (APS) (2023)** | NHIS | *Internal Policy Paper* | This policy study analyses the reform and implementation of the **Alternative Payment System** within the **UK National Health Service (NHS)**, marking a shift towards a collaborative, prevention-focused, and value-driven healthcare-financing model. In response to challenges such as population ageing, chronic disease burdens, and the COVID-19 backlog, the NHS introduced **blended payment models**, **performance-linked incentives (CQUIN, Best Practice Tariffs)**, and **population-based systems** to enhance quality and efficiency. Guided by the **Health and Social Care Act 2012**, these reforms are embedded through **Integrated Care Systems (ICSs)** and the **Aligned Payment and Incentive (API)** framework, combining fixed, variable, and outcome-based funding. The **Patient-Level Information and Costing System (PLICS)** supports transparency and accountability. Although Koreaâ€™s health-financing structure differs from the UKâ€™s Beveridge model, the UK experience offers lessons on balancing fixed and variable budgets, embedding preventive incentives, and aligning efficiency with public accountability. |
| **The Young Climate Activistsâ€™ Toolkit in the Middle East and North Africa / Arab States Region (2022)** | UNICEF MENA | [View Toolkit](https://www.unicef.org/mena/reports/young-climate-activists-toolkit) | A four-volume resource empowering young climate leaders across the MENA region. Volume 1 explains core climate concepts and terminology; Volume 2 outlines tools for climate action aligned with the **Paris Agreement** and **SDGs**; Volume 3 introduces **climate governance** and participation mechanisms; Volume 4 simplifies the **Paris Agreement** for youth audiences, presenting its articles and significance in accessible language. |
| **Mitigating the Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Children in Jordan (2020)** | UNV | [Read Article](https://www.unv.org/Success-stories/mitigating-impact-covid-19-vulnerable-children-jordan) | UNV feature highlighting initiatives to protect vulnerable children in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic through cross-sectoral partnerships and youth-led community engagement. |

UNICEFâ€™s integrated approach works across policy, business, and education systems to strengthen the ecosystem and create equitable opportunities for young people. |
